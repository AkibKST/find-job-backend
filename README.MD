## Project Name: Find job portal system backend.

## I have been assigned the task of building the backend for a find job portal System. The main focus of this project is to implement error handling, CRUD operations, authentication, and authorization, Transaction & Rollback (If necessary)

### Story

### üìú Best Practices Followed

### üßπ Code Quality

# Modular Code: Code is divided into reusable components and modules for better maintainability.

# Clean and Readable: Proper indentation, meaningful variable names, and comments for clarity.

# DRY Principle: Reused logic to avoid redundancy and ensure maintainability.

# Consistent Naming Conventions: Followed camelCase for variables and functions, and PascalCase for components.

### üö¶ Error Handling

- Frontend Errors: Clear and user-friendly error messages are displayed for invalid inputs, failed requests, or other issues.
- Backend Errors: Properly structured error responses with HTTP status codes.
- Boundary Testing: Validations to handle edge cases and ensure application stability.

### üîí Security

- JWT Authentication: Used secure JSON Web Tokens to protect API endpoints and user sessions.
- Input Validation: Sanitized and validated user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection.
- Protected Routes: Ensured sensitive pages and APIs are accessible only to authenticated users.

### üñåÔ∏è Responsive Design

- Mobile-First Approach: Designed the UI to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes.
- Scalable Layouts: Used flexible grid systems (Tailwind CSS) to ensure cross-device compatibility.
- Accessible UI: Followed web accessibility standards to enhance usability for all users.

### üìÇ Project Organization

- Folder Structure: Followed a clear folder structure separating components, pages, services, and assets.
- Meaningful Commits: Used descriptive commit messages to track changes effectively.
- README Documentation: Added detailed instructions for setting up, running, and understanding the project.

### ‚ö° Performance Optimization

- Lazy Loading: Dynamically loaded components to improve initial page load speed.
- Efficient State Management: Used local state and React Query to manage data efficiently.
- Reduced Re-renders: Optimized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders for better performance.

### üåê Deployment

# Error-Free Hosting: Ensured the deployed application is free of runtime errors.

# Live Updates: Automatically updates changes on the live application through CI/CD pipelines.

# Environment Variables: Secured sensitive data using .env files.

### ‚úÖ Testing

- Manual Testing: Tested all user flows to ensure the app functions as intended.
- Error Scenarios: Simulated errors to verify the robustness of error-handling mechanisms.
- These practices ensure that the project is scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly. üöÄ

### Middleware and Error Handling:

1. **No Data Found**:
   - When finding data, if the database collection is empty or does not match any data, return a generic message: "No data found."
     - **Response**:
       ```json
       {
         "success": false,
         "message": "No Data Found",
         "data": []
       }
       ```
2. **Error Handling**:

   - Implement proper error handling throughout the application. Use global error handling middleware to catch and handle errors, providing appropriate error responses error messages.
   - Error Response Object should include the following properties:

     - **success**: false
     - **message**: Error Type (e.g., Validation Error, Cast Error, Duplicate Entry)
     - **errorMessages**:
       ```json
       [
         {
           "path": "",
           "message": "Error message"
         }
       ]
       ```
     - **Sample Error Response**:

       ```json
       {
         "success": false,
         "message": "E11000 duplicate key error collection:: email_1 dup key: { email: \\"user2@gmail.com\\" }",
         "errorMessages": [
           {
             "path": "",
             "message": "E11000 duplicate key error index: email_1 dup key: { email: \\"user2@gmail.com\\" }"
           }
         ],
         "stack": "error stack"
       }

       ```

3. **Not Found Route**:
   - Implement a global "Not Found" handler for unmatched routes. When a route is not found, respond with a generic message: "Not Found."
     - **Response**:
       ```json
       {
         "success": false,
         "statusCode": 404,
         "message": "Not Found"
       }
       ```

### **4\. Authentication Middleware:**

Implement an Authentication Middleware to authenticate your application. Ensures that only user and admin can access their own accessible routes.

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "statusCode": 401,
  "message": "You have no access to this route"
}
```

### **5\. Zod Validation:**

The API employs Zod for input validation, ensuring data consistency. When validation fails, a 400 Bad Request status code is returned, accompanied by detailed error messages specifying the erroneous fields and reasons.
